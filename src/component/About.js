I graduated from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) in Bangalore, where I honed my skills and deepened my understanding of the ever-evolving field of technology.

// <h1 className='font-bold'>My Journey</h1>
// From a young age, I was fascinated by the world of computers and technology. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in computer science engineering at VTU, one of Bangalore's premier institutions. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in various programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies.

// <h1>Skills & Expertise</h1>
// As a front-end developer, I specialize in creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Here are some of the key skills and technologies I bring to the table:<br></br>

// HTML5 & CSS3: Crafting semantic and accessible markup, and designing visually appealing and responsive layouts.<br></br>
// JavaScript: Building interactive web experiences using vanilla JavaScript as well as popular libraries and frameworks like React.js.<br></br>
// React.js: Developing component-based applications, ensuring efficient rendering and state management.<br></br>
// Tailwind CSS: Utilizing utility-first CSS for rapid and consistent styling.<br></br>
// Responsive Design: Ensuring websites are fully functional and aesthetically pleasing across all devices and screen sizes.
// Version Control: Proficient with Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development.<br></br>
// APIs: Integrating third-party APIs to add functionality and improve user experience.<br></br>
// <h1>My Philosophy</h1>
// I believe that the key to a successful web application lies in its ability to provide an exceptional user experience. My goal is to bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality, creating web applications that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and efficient.
